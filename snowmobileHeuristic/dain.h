// we will set all values in the current best path's coordinates in the bestCol 2d array to -(best value), which can
// easily be checked at every node. if a node is negative, the algorithm will know that it is on the best path. then 
// we can very simply just compare the current #collisions in the current path with the absolute value of the #collisions
// in the best path. replace accordingly
    // a minor problem that pops up from this is nmaking the coordinates of the current path negative if it becomes a new 
    // best path. we will have to iterate backwards from here, probably make a helper function to do so. make all points
    // no longer in the best path positive, make all new points negative
// so in practice, bestnum is 0 if it hasn't been reached yet, ie hasn't been explored down a path; positive if it is just a
// normal point, and negative if it is a point in the set of best coordinates
