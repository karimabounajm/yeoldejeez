    // a minor problem that pops up from this is nmaking the coordinates of the current path negative if it becomes a new 
    // best path. we will have to iterate backwards from here, probably make a helper function to do so. make all points
    // no longer in the best path positive, make all new points negative
// so in practice, bestnum is 0 if it hasn't been reached yet, ie hasn't been explored down a path; positive if it is just a
// normal point, and negative if it is a point in the set of best coordinates
