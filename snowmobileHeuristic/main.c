// new idea, we create our own .txt files with a defined number of columns + rows
// we take a random number between 3 and 7 for each row, and put that many trees in it out 
// of a ration of 10 (adjust accordingly)
// add it to the run.sh file, we overwrite the previous created txt file. create a .c file to
// print out such a map, and use >> after first clearing with >

// so because we are using a 2d array of ints to describe the current best collisions and an array of 
// transformations of the x value alone to describe the current best path, it is difficult to identify 
// what coordinates are on the current best path for the heuristic to reject the path. because of this, 
// we will set all values in the current best path's coordinates in the bestCol 2d array to -(best value), which can
// easily be checked at every node. if a node is negative, the algorithm will know that it is on the best path. then 
// we can very simply just compare the current #collisions in the current path with the absolute value of the #collisions
// in the best path. replace accordingly
    // a minor problem that pops up from this is nmaking the coordinates of the current path negative if it becomes a new 
    // best path. we will have to iterate backwards from here, probably make a helper function to do so. make all points
    // no longer in the best path positive, make all new points negative
// so in practice, bestnum is 0 if it hasn't been reached yet, ie hasn't been explored down a path; positive if it is just a
// normal point, and negative if it is a point in the set of best coordinates. quick update to this, it would not work if the
// number of collisions at a particular node at its best is naturally 0. look for ways to distinguish between the two. 


// i am fairly certain that writing this using a method similar to the binary tree implementation is possible, as we could write
// a function or a class using code based on the number of inputs by the user, but honestly I have no idea how to do this yet;
// think I might revisit the way I do this sometime in the future, to see if using higher order functions is possible.
// I'm getting this from Silicon valley, dinesh, who said something about writing functions that spit out other functions. he used
// Java though, so I might have to wait until I learn that and gain some fluency in it.

// the above is (obviously) in reference to the way I am implementing the recursive search. I was just relooking through ecs32b notes
// and saw the way that the binary tree was searched for using look left/right, and I wonder if writing functions to do something 
// similar based on the speed the user inputs would be worth looking into; said it would run in n time, but that's probably only if
// we have a finite and defined number of branches coming out of each node

// important notes

// kaloti recommends writing a priority cue (binary heap), which isn't available in C but is in 
// C++, so consider rewriting in C++ after finishin in C; comparing speeds would be interesting,
// but finish this first;
    // mini update, create a ((2 * speed) - 1)ary tree which allows changing the coordinate of 
    // focus to a particular place in the current 2d array map for coordinate's least #col
    // this would reduce runtime by allowing us to quickly access the number of coordinates 
    // in a timely fashion at the particular coordinate. i really like this 
    // things are getting a bit crazy here, but wowee.
