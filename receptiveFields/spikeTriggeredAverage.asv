% convolving the STA just found with the stimulus (without using conv)
% result would be an estimate of the membrane potential of the cell at each time-point during the 
% presentation of the provided stimulus. Since a rising membrane potential puts a cell closer to 
% its spiking threshold, this value can be somewhat related to firing rate because higher membrane 
% potential values are related to higher firing rates.

lenConv = length(averageSpikeTrigger) + length(stim);

% filled with zeroes

% the outer for loop iterating through the indices of the convolution vector itself, not the 
% component adjusted STA and stim vectors; one more thing, zeros nearly gave me a migrana, it 
% forms vectors instead of array and is a pain.

        % checking back on what convolving does mathematically, the convolution vector being 
        % created will hold by index the sum of every product value of the two vectors by time; 
        
        % convolution usually does things through integration, but Riemann sums will do the 
        % trick here, with each index of the final vector holding a summation of the previously 
        % mentioned values
        
        % in terms of implementation, that means interating over every possible value and summing 
        % them up if the condition that the indices don't take the arrays/vectors out of bounds. 
        % MATLAB has the first vector start at 1 and doesn't have >= conditional, so instead check 
        % if i - j + 1 > 0 instead of i - j â‰¥ 0
        
        if(i - j + 1) > 0
            % again, it irks me off to have to add 1;
