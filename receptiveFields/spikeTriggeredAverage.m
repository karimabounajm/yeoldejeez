% next step, create a kernel function which uses the STA to find the relative likelihood of the
% receptive field firing during an input stimulus through convolving the STA with the stimulus.
% Might also want to also potentially add the ability to update the STA with the values in the
% new stimulus if it includes when it fires, maybe comparing accuracy before and after assimilating
% the values in the functionality.

% notes:
% divide STA by euclidian norm, ro normalize the convolved vector, make more orderly
% next: take the vector of spikes from data, turn into rates based on
% convolution
% or take the stimulus vector, and turn into predicted spikes
