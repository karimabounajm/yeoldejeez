For this, I want to try coding an AVL tree, and a bunch of other algorithms. Even better, I want to see if it's possible to write a diagnostic test that takes a minute performing different functions on code and data structures, and decides which way to organize data is most efficient. Essentially, create a diagnostic tool that objectively shows what methods are best suited for a given amount of data

Bonus points if this can be costumized to show by different processes, like if AVL trees/has binary type trees can even work with it, which one respectively would be best suited for which task (which itself would be tested in the diagnostic process, and speed at which it is run will be used to compare the two.)

I want this to be in Rust. Rust is cool, and according to a few peeps is the langauge most code is written in these days, so long as its new.
