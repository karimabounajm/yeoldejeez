You can test your own implementation by comparing the output maximum flow and runtime with the VacRouter.out executable inside the data folder and the CSV data files generated by the createUSA.out executable.

Note: depth first search is not always the most efficient or an entirely correct way of implementing network flow, however for some graphs, such as those create by createUSA.out, its general outward flowing topographic structure enables it to work and work efficiently. Using Dijkstra's for a more conventional Ford-Fulkerson network flow algorithm is a slower but more consistent choice.
