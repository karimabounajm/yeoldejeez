The testhw and the Testing directory are available for use at this time.
Copy testhw to one of your own directories.
There is no need to copy the Testing directory.
testhw takes only one argument--the directory that holds your spreader.cpp source code.
testhw will copy from the Testing directory the SpreaderRunner.*, and CPUTimer.h.
It then compiles your program using your Makefile, and runs it with the three 
covid-2000000-10-*.csv files as its command line parameter.  
The results are placed in the results.txt file in the directory with the source code in it.
